# ⭐️ How to upgrade to PRO

The **PRO feature** costs USD 10$.

### 💳 Stripe (USD) - Immediate Access
You can pay by **Stripe** directly via the AxieDex extension. **Please note that we are not collecting any of your payment information** so rest assured 🙏

Your access will then be granted **immediately** after payment.

### 🍺 Ronin Wallet (SLP) - Access after 1 or 2 days
You can opt to pay me via **Ronin** by sending me the equivalent of USD $25 in **SLP** 👍🏻

- First, make a transfer to the following Ronin Wallet address
```
ronin:10823fc96b4ea998f6e4ef56b1a9cf663a2b19a3
```

- Then send me an email at **<a href="mailto:sukikoso.jp@gmail.com">sukikoso.jp@gmail.com</a>** with the following template.

```
Subject: AxieDex Payment via Ronin - {email}

Hi Tony!
