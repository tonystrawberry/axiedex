### 🌱 Display of Axie Dominant, Recessive and Minor Recessive Genes on the Marketplace, Inventory and Axie Details Page

The **Dominant**, **Recessive** and **Minor Recessive Genes** are displayed on each Axie card above the Axie illustration. This is extremely useful for players looking for specific parts.

It is also possible to hide them by default and activate the display by **hovering** over the Axie card. This option can be set in the AxieDex Chrome Extension menu.

### 🌱 PRO FEATURE 😎 Highlight Axies in the Marketplace based on the Purity value

If you are looking for Axies based on their **purity** value, you can make the Axie card stand out by **adding a automatic highlight in the color of your choice**.

In the AxieDex Chrome Extension, associate a purity value (from 0 to 100%) with a color (in HEX value) and apply the changes.

This feature is especially useful for **breeders** who wish to find the Axies with the **perfect** parts.
